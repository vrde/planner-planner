# planner-planner

Planner Planner is an experiment in creating and bookbind a custom planner.

Check:

- The [presentation](./presentation.pdf) I gave at hack'n'tell
- The [PDF of the planner](./Planner.pdf)
- My [postmortem](./docs/20240118) of the first planner I created, that is terrible but that's ok.
